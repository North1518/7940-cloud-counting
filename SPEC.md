Comp7940 group project :
====================
The first plan :

1.Only using python and its library to do this project and using git for version control. The JavaScript + HTML code will not store in the server <br>
2.Choosing do the line chat bot <br>
3.Using a Redis server to store some persistent information, also using other servers to store the data which is extracted from web sides. <br>
4.Our project will be running on the Heroku, or other similar cloud ( if we can handle some cloud that is more difficult than the Heroku, we will use this one) <br>
5.Our project want to grab data from web sides. The accuracy of information is based on the data, maybe is the latest information or maybe not. <br>
6.Our project try to use the data to show the news about the COVID-19 : <br>

A)input a region and show this area news about this kind of disease, (1 days change about the patients confirm and deaths, or others information) <br>
B)Report the Medical items stock such as the masks, protective clothing and others ( we try to get some regions medical items and accurate to a single medical institutions if the data is very detailed) <br>
C)Give some useful information about how to protect yourself, there is some health care knowledge, such as washing hands after go back home or how to wear masks or other something like that.  <br>
D) Report the local news (HongKong) about the disease ( we try to use the data from government) contain the confirm cases behaviors so that people can choose not to go to these public places to avoid the risk of infection <br>

Attention : <br>
